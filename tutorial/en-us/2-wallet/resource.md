### Creating a wallet
There are several options available to you when creating a new wallet.

For full blockchain synchronization, consider:

- NEO-GUI -> https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/gui/install.html
- NEO-CLI -> https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/cli.html

For light clients which do not require synchronization, consider:

- O3 Wallet -> https://o3.network/
- NEON Wallet -> https://neonwallet.com/

You can find more detailed usage guides at the relevant wallet links.
