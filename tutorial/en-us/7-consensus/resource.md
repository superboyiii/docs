### Practical exercise (hands-on)

We suggest that those who are interested in initializing, testing, and observing dBFT consensus take some time to view the [NeoCompiler-Eco Github](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco), following its guidelines for setting up a local blockchain system. 

Follow the [README](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco/blob/master/README.md) and the steps described therein to initialize the consensus nodes on your private network according to your desired specification.
