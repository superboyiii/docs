## Smart Contract Fees

The fee structure for Smart Contracts can be found in the tables below.

The initial 10 GAS during each execution of every smart contract is always free, including smart contract deployment and invoking. That is, fees that sum up to 10 GAS or less will not require a service fee.

The fees below are minimum fees. The user can choose to pay extra for priority.

All Smart Contract fees are considered as Service fee to be put in a pool for re-distribution to all NEO holders. The distribution is proportional to amount of NEO.
