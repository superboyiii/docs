## Outline
Although a developer may want to build their own custom contract, one of the benefits of a blockchain ecosystem is the ability to access and use shared contracts and assets in the public space. Typically a user would interact with these through a wallet application, if a wallet conforms to a standard dAPI interface, then a developer can begin interacting with assets and smart contracts without ever having to access the lower level toolchain. This workshop will guide you on how to connect to a dAPI compatible browser in order to gain full access to the underlying blockchain ecosystem.
