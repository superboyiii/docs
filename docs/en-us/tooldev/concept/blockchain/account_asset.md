# Asset and Account

### Asset

There are two kinds of assets in NEO: One is UTXO-type global assets, such as NEO and GAS. They are defined in Genesis Block. The other is NEP5 assets, which is generated by a smart contract. The former are recorded in transactions, while the latter are stored in the contracts' storage space.

| Size | Field  | Type | Description |
|--|-------|------|------|
| 32  | AssetId | UInt256 | `assetid = tx.hash` |
| 1 | AssetType | AssetType | |
| ? | Name | string | |
| 8 | Amount  |Fixed8 |  `amount = -Fixed8.Satoshi = -1 = infinity`  |
| 8 | Available | Fixed8 |   |
| 1 | Precision | byte |   |
| 1 | FeeMode | const byte |   |
| 8 | Fee  | Fixed8 |   |
| 20 | FeeAddress | UInt160 | default `null`   |
| ? | Owner  | ECPoint |   |
| 20 | Admin  | UInt160  |   |
| 20 | Issuer  | UInt160 |   |
| 4 | Expiration  | uint  |   |
| 1 | IsFrozen  | bool | Frozen assets, cannot be transferred  |

> [!NOTE]
>
> There are two models of `Amount`: One is unlimited, the amount is set to `-Fixed8.Satoshi`, which means infinity. The other is fixed amount that cannot be modified.

| Size | Field | Type | Descriptoin |
|------|-------|------|------|
| 20 | ScriptHash | UInt160 | The hash of account's script contract. |
| 1  | IsFrozen   | bool    | Fronzen accounts cannot transfer. This field is not currently used. |
| ? * ? | Votes  | ECPoint[] | the voted address list |
| ? | Balances  |Dict<UInt256, Fixed8> | UTXO assets, mapping from assetId to amount.  |
